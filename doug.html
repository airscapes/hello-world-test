this was a file I created in /tmp and tired to added to the rep from /tmp
But no, you have to have the file in the rep to add it.. 


Added this to see what it looks like in the git diff


After creating a brach (first_branch) I did a git checkout first_branch and edited this file.
I will now commit it and switch back to master??
